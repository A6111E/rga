This instance then contains all the functions needed to extract data, and all the data needed for the authentication and reauthentication. The class is in essence self sustaining.\r\n\r\n#### Basic use\r\n\r\nThe instance is created with the `rga.open` command:\r\n\r\n\t// create instance\r\n\trga.open(instance=\"ga\")\r\n\r\nThis will check if the instance is already created, and if it is, it'll prepare the token. If the instance is not created, it'll create the instance, and redirect the client to a browser for authentication with Google.\r\n\r\n#### Advanced use\r\n\r\nIf you want to store the instance locally, this can be done by adding the `where` attribute:\r\n\r\n\t// create a local instance\r\n\trga.open(instance=\"ga\", where=\"~/ga.rga\")\r\n\r\n","google":""}
